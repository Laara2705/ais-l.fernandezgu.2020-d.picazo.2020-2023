<p align="justify">The purpose of this practice is to work with the GitFlow model developed by Vincent Driessen in 2010, providing our application with a framework for branch and version management, aiding in maintaining an organized and efficient structure. It enables development teams to work more collaboratively and help us to ensure the construction of high-quality software. As we progressed with the project, we explored various workflows and incorporated additional functionalities, including the implementation of new features in the sample app. This involved creating essential branches and subjecting our changes to rigorous validation processes to ensure seamless integration with the rest of the project. Furthermore, we adopted the GitFlow model to align our development practices with the day-to-day operations of the business.</p>
